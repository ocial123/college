      <h2>Free school for children of workers</h2>

      <h3>As many as 93 children between 5 and 10 years who have not been able to access formal education yet will be imparted free of cost education in this school.
 They will also be provided school uniforms and bags.
Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said, “The students will be introduced to English, Hindi alphabets, basic mathematics and other subjects. We will try to make them read and write.
 Thereafter, they will go through a test. On that basis, they will be admitted in class.”
Though LMC is yet to make a decision on getting accreditation from the state board to set up a formal school at Kanha Upvan, based on the performance of these children,
 the civic body might convert it into an accredited school., may 23, 2022</h3>
